<h2>Narrative:</h2>
<p>
 This week our team had our usual weekly meeting and found no one had brought any snacks! 
Luckly, Outstanding Mouse saved the day and pointed us toward some SOM provided sandwiches outside our meeting, 
 so the team did not work while hangry.  Because of time constraints this week, including an impending final, 
 this was a lower points week for us. Our team this week focused on setting up the Google Analytics 
 and running the a/b testing this week. Our team started by creating a Google Analytics account under
 cautious-coyote’s credentials to generate the Google tracker.  With this in hand, we added the Google
 generated code to our layout view file so that it would propagate across all pages of our site.  
 A major malfunction occurred when cautious-coyote overwrote much of shy-wolverine’s work on the master branch of our 
 published site.  Having previously learned how to work off of old commits, our team had to do significant research to
 understand how to do forced pushes to the origin in order to update the head of the production code to a prior commit.  
 With this resolved, the team was also able to add the “Donate Button” code and create a donation landing page.
 </p>

<p>
 This was also the first week we did not complete our sprint as planned.  
 The team hoped to implement a/b testing this week but struggled to figure out how to implement it 
 and was unable to make progress at office hours. We decided to wait until the video about a/b testing is posted.
 So, unfortunately this story is now part of our final 
 sprint, but we consider the free food and drinks we got while visiting L400 to be the silver lining in our failed 
 attempt to begin a/b testing. 
 </p>
 
<h2>Current backlog in order of priority </h2>
<ul>
 <li>Implement a/b testing (8 points)</li>
<li>Create RSVP form that does not include invalid or non-yale e-mail but allows multiple yale e-mail even when scrambled (21 points)</li>
 <li>Create link so when event is created automatically directed to new event creation (8 point)</li>
 <li>Make page searchable (5 points)</li>
 <li>Should return JSON (5 points)</li>
 <li>Analyze Google analytics results (3 points)</li>
<li>Final presentation prep (8 points)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Narrative of what expected work before next report:</h2>
 
<p>
 Our next sprint we are going to finalize the project. 
 Our first priority is to set up a/b testing.  
 Next, we want to link the database to the new events. 
 In it’s current state, the SQL database only exports events, 
 and it is not currently wired to our New Events page.  
 Also, we need to make sure users are redirected to the create a new 
 event page when they try to create a new event.  Finally, we must make the page searchable and return JOSN. 
 We also plan to use our meeting to look a the google analytic results from the week to include in our final report.
 Finally, we plan to work on further beautifying our already beautiful website to enter in the design 
 contest the last day of class and enjoying some delicious food, brought by all team members at our final meeting.
