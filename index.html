<h2>Burn down chart:</h2>
  <p>
  Yeah, we crushed the development of this app.  
  Our innovative pair programing approach, regular sprint stand-up meetings, 
  and effective segregation of stories to allow simultaneous development of features 
  allowed us to thrash the development of this app in a transparent, accountable, and 
  productive manner (while hopefully minimizing our utilization of TA annoyance quota).
  The results clearly speak for themselves; feel our golden-wrath.

<h2>Completed stories for Final Sprint 4 (58 points total):</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Implement a/b testing (8 points)</li>
<li>Create RSVP form that does not include invalid or non-yale e-mail but allows multiple yale e-mail even when scrambled (21 points)</li>
 <li>Create link so when event is created automatically directed to new event creation (8 point)</li>
 <li>Make page searchable (5 points)</li>
 <li>Should return JSON (5 points)</li>
 <li>Analyze Google analytics results (3 points)</li>
<li>Final presentation prep (8 points)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Narrative:</h2>
<p>
This sprint was a heavy sprint points wise.  
  We finished the RVSP form parameters first, making sure invalid e-mails were not allowed and that multiple 
  Yale e-mails were allowed even when combined.  These parameters were challenging to finish and required some
  trial and error to get it to past the test (thanks for saving the day, Surya!!), but in the end we prevailed. 
  Also, we created links so when the event was created it was automatically directed to the new event, 
  made sure the site returned a valid JSON, and was searchable.  We also did a 10 point run this week, 
  running up and down East rock hill at 7:50 pace (aggressive!). 
  Double win - passing all the automated tests and staying in shape!
 </p>

<p>
   The last thing we did was complete A/B testing, analyze the results, 
  and determine who the most generous (see below for results).  
  We went with a minimalist approach for our project design, 
  our team employed the Jonathan Ive approach to event planning design: less is more. 
  I hope you enjoy the Donation page.
 </p>
 
  
  <h2>A Note About Git Branches:</h2>
<p>
 We probably screwed this one up.  We have been using local git branches on our personal IDEs
  to develop new features, test their integration, and then merge back into the master before 
  pushing back to GitHub.  Individual developers such as outstanding-mouse had up to 4 different 
  feature branches going at a time to contain propagation of bugs and ensure smooth integration with
  the team’s master branch.  However, it was not until this last sprint that we realized branches are
  only trackable and accessible across the team if pushed to the origin.  We belatedly employed 
  this strategy to manage rework that had to be done without interrupting ongoing database 
  integration efforts, but we clearly did not make the extent of our Git utilization strategy
  transparent to outsiders.  As opposed to our local branch strategy, a much more Agile-embracing
  approach would have been to create and utilize public (origin/GitHub hosted) branches for
  feature development, testing/integration, and staging, in addition to our mainline master.  Oops.
   </p>
  
  <p>
That being said, our team universally 
    agrees that version control is a mysterious, powerful,
    and awe-inspiring force that we are not worthy of.  Each one of us has an example
    about when Git saved the day, from allowing us to trash our crappy attempts and pull
    back down our known working master code to rolling back to previous commits when 
    cautious-coyote accidentally overwrote the entire database connection schema for the app. 
    We <3 Git, and hope that one day, Git will <3 us too.
  </p>
  
  
   <h2>Traffi findings:</h2>
 <p>
We had 12 sources of traffic.  The most common was traffic from SOM (44.15%), 
   followed by yale.edu (30.32%).  Every other segment was less than 10% with medicine (9.25%),
   direct (5.8%), law (5.13%) being the top five. May of the others were us or the TAs looking at the website (see chart below). 
   Our overall conversion rate was .78%, with our group testing being the most generous :). 
   Of the student groups, law students were the most generous with 2.17% donation rate and stingy
   SOM students were next with .37% rate.  The medical student loans and future of many years of 
   residency must have prevented the medical students from donating, with no one contributing. 
  </p>
  
  
 <h2>A/B testing results:</h2>
 <p>
Our experient directed 55 people to donate and 68 people to support. 
   We found donate to have a much higher conversion rate (7.27) than support (1.47%).
   This was consistent for all days except Dec 11 (see chart below). 
   
  </p>
  
 <h2>Special features:</h2>
<p>
The website includes special features such as: A custom designed logo designed based off our team name “Golden Wrath.”  
 Thoughtful pictures that accurately represent each team member’s personality and attractiveness level (one person really does look like an Ostrich). 
 Finally, our project includes countless hours of blood, sweat and tears, as well as some learning.
