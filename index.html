<h2>Narrative:</h2>
<p>
This sprint was a heavy sprint points wise.  
 We finished the RVSP form parameters first, making sure invalid e-mails were not allowed and that multiple yale e-mails
 were allowed even when combined.  These parameters were challenging to finish and required some trial 
 and error to get it to past the test, but in the end we prevailed.  
 Also, we also created links so when the event was created it was automatically directed to 
 create a new event and made sure the site returned a valid JSON and was searchable.  
 We also did a 10 point run this week, running up and down East rock hill at 7:50 pace. 
 Now the website was passing all the tests and we were staying in shape!
 </p>

<p>
The last thing we did was complete A/B testing, analyzing the results and seeing who the most generous (see below for results). 
 We went with a minimalist approach for our project design, as our team believes more is less when it comes to event planning.
 </p>
 
 <h2>A/B testing results:</h2>
 <p>

  </p>
  
 <h2>Special features:</h2>
<p>
The website includes special features such as: A custom designed logo designed based off our team name “Golden Wrath.”  
 Thoughtful pictures that accurately represent each team member’s personality and attractiveness level (one person really does look like an Ostrich). 
 Finally, our project includes countless hours of blood, sweat and tears, as well as some learning.
